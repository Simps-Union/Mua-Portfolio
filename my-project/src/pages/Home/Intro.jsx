                I enjoy coding in my free time. (Not really) I just do it because
                they say this field pays well. We are trying to live that luxury
                <br />life out here.
                
                I cannot wait to hear "yeah my daughter is a software developer" "My
                girlfriend works for Spotify, Google, and allðŸ˜Š"
                <br /> Plus yes I am trying get into tech but I'm just a bit slow but
                not to worry I will get there with God on my side.
